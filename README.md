#Be Nice or Leave
A social networking site for sharing nice things.

##Status
The current incarnation of BNOL is a microblogging site in the spirit of old-school Twitter, based on the [Minitwit](https://github.com/pallets/flask/tree/master/examples/minitwit) example included with the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) microframework.

The idea is to get something up and running as quickly as possible and not get side-tracked by thinking about features, technology, etc.  That said, there are a few Issues opened to expand the features of Minitwit in areas that seem useful, and as such pull requests to address these issues are welcome.
