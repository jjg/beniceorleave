  <i><b>Notice!</b> this is an experimental system and all data may be lost at any time (see this as a blessing or a curse, your call).</i>
  <p>Yyou don't need to provide your real email address during <b>alpha 0</b>, the system doesn't use it for anything yet (that is unless you want to change your avatar, see below).</p>
  <p>Avatar images are generated using <a href="https://secure.gravatar.com/">Gravatar</a>.  If you'd like something other than the auto-generated image, visit <a href="https://secure.gravatar.com/">https://secure.gravatar.com/</a> to change it and eventually the new image will show up here.</p>
  <p>There's currenty no way to reset your password, so don't forget it; or do forget it, and create a new account!  It's a free-for-all at this point so best not to get too invested.</p>
  <p>Most of this will get addressed in the next version (<a href="https://github.com/jjg/beniceorleave/milestone/2">alpha 1</a>).  In the meantime if you find anything wrong that's not on this list, visit the <a href="https://github.com/jjg/beniceorleave/issues">bugtracker on Github</a> and create a new Issue if you want someone to look into it.</p>
  <p>Most of all be nice and have fun.  Everything is temporary and reality is an illusion. <a href="/jjg">--jjg</a></p>
